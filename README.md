# Collaboration revolutions in Quaive

About developments in collaborative editing for Quaive and how that relates to Plone.

Quaive is a social intranet platform which promotes easy collaboration on documents.
However, realtime collaboration was only possible via the OnlyOffice suite which is part of Quaive.
Now, that the tools and technologies are available, we want to go further and make real time collaboration available throughout Quaive.

This talk explains the current status, where we want to go from there and how Plone can benefit from this.
